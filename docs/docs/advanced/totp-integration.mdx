## How to extract TOTP code from your authenticator app

After following the guide, you will get a TOTP secret. You can use this secret in your automations.


## Simple way to use TOTP in your automations

You can hardcode the TOTP secret in your automation. It should be provided in the `secure_parameters` dictionary.

```json
"secure_parameters": {
  "authenticator_code": [
    {
      "totp": {
        "totp_secret": "TOTP_SECRET"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Secure way to use TOTP in your automations

More secure way to use TOTP in your automations is to store the TOTP secret in One Password. You can learn more about how to do this in the [One Password Integration](/docs/advanced/onepassword) documentation.

```json
"secure_parameters": {
  "authenticator_code": [
    {
      "onepassword": {
        "type": "totp_secret",
        "item_name": "item_name_in_one_password",
        "field_name": "authenticator_code_field_name",
        "vault_name": "vault_name_in_one_password"
      },
    }
  ]
}
```
