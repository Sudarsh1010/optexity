### What is Optexity?

Optexity is a platform for building and running browser automations.

### Do I need to build new automation for each user or login credentials for each user?

No, you can use the same automation for multiple users by using parameters.

### How do I use parameters?

You can use parameters by using the `{parameter_name[0]}` syntax in your automation. If this is used in for loop, you can use `{parameter_name[index]}` syntax to access the current value of the loop. For more information, see the [Parameters](/docs/building-automations/parameters) documentation.

### How do I use secure parameters?

You can use secure parameters by using the `secure_parameters` field in your automation and inference request. In secure parameters you do not specify the actual value. instead you specify how you want to retrieve the value at runtime. Currently, we support One Password and TOTP. You can learn more about secure parameters in the [Secure Parameters](/docs/building-automations/parameters#secure-parameters) documentation.

### I do not want to hardcode passwords in my automation. What opetions do I have?

You can use secure parameters by using the `secure_parameters` field in your automation and inference request. In secure parameters you do not specify the actual value. instead you specify how you want to retrieve the value at runtime. Currently, we support One Password and TOTP. You can learn more about secure parameters in the [Secure Parameters](/docs/building-automations/parameters#secure-parameters) documentation.

### I do not want to send passwords in the request body. How can I use secure parameters?

You can use secure parameters by using the `secure_parameters` field in your automation and inference request. In secure parameters you do not specify the actual value. instead you specify how you want to retrieve the value at runtime. Currently, we support One Password and TOTP. You can learn more about secure parameters in the [Secure Parameters](/docs/building-automations/parameters#secure-parameters) documentation.

### I want to download multiple files in single run. How can I do that?

You can use `for_loop_node` to iterate over multiple values and download files. For more information, see the [For Loop Node](/docs/building-automations/for-loop-node) documentation.

### I want to do actions on multple things which i see on the page. How can I do that?

You can use `for_loop_node` to iterate over multiple values and perform actions on them. For more information, see the [For Loop Node](/docs/building-automations/for-loop-node) documentation.

### I want to do one action if one condition is met and another action if another condition is met. How can I do that?

You can use `if_else_node` to perform one action if one condition is met and another action if another condition is met. For more information, see the [If Else Node](/docs/building-automations/if-else-node) documentation.

### Do I need to build new automation for each condition?

No. You can use `if_else_node` to perform one action if one condition is met and another action if another condition is met. For more information, see the [If Else Node](/docs/building-automations/if-else-node) documentation.

### Do I need to build new automation for each loging credentials?

No. You can use parameters and secure parameters to run the automation for different login credentials and not have to build the automation again. These can be sent in inference request.

### My portal is secured by 2FA. Can I use Optexity to login?

Yes we provide inegration to authenticator apps like Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Authy, etc. You can learn more about how to use authenticator apps in the [TOTP Integration](/docs/advanced/totp-integration) documentation.

### Do you handle TOTP codes?

Yes we provide inegration to authenticator apps like Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Authy, etc. You can learn more about how to use authenticator apps in the [TOTP Integration](/docs/advanced/totp-integration) documentation.

### Do you handle OTP over gmail?

Yes this is a work in progress and we will provide you with details shortly,

### How do I access downloaded files?

You can access downloaded files by using the `GET /api/v1/get_downloads` endpoint. You can learn more about how to use this endpoint in the [HTTP API](/api-reference/task_details/get-downloads) documentation.

### Where is my extracted data stored?

It is stored in optexity cloud storage. You can access it by using the `GET /api/v1/get_output_data` endpoint. You can learn more about how to use this endpoint in the [HTTP API](/api-reference/task_details/get-output-data) documentation.

### Do I have to poll to get the data?

No. You can setup a callback URL in the dashboard and we will send the callback data to the URL you specify. You can learn more about how to use callbacks in the [Callbacks](/docs/advanced/callbacks) documentation.

### Can you send a callback when the automation is done?

Yes. You can setup a callback URL in the dashboard and we will send the callback data to the URL you specify. You can learn more about how to use callbacks in the [Callbacks](/docs/advanced/callbacks) documentation.

### Do you have a free tier?

All automations are free to build and run using the opensource version of Optexity. You can checkout the [github repo](https://github.com/Optexity/optexity)

### Do you give browser in cloud?

Yes. Please request cloud access by contacting us at founders@optexity.com

### Do you handle CAPTCHAs?

Yes we provide stealth mode in both opensource and cloud version which prevents most of the CAPTCHAs

### How to skip command when the action is nondeterministic

If you do not provide command, then we directly fallback to ai prompt for action.

### How to fill something in box and then select from the drop-down

you should use two actions one after the another. first input somehting in text box. then wait for few seconds for dropdown to populate. then select the value using the prompt based click as generally you do not know the exact locator. if you know the exact locator, then you can use the command based click.

```json
[
    {
        "type": "action_node",
        "interaction_action": {
            "input_text": {
                "command": "get_by_role(\"textbox\", name=\"Type search term here\")",
                "prompt_instructions": "Fill the SOC code search field with the text '{soc_code_search_term[0]}'.",
                "input_text": "{soc_code_search_term[0]}"
            }
        },
        "end_sleep_time": 1
    },
    {
        "type": "action_node",
        "interaction_action": {
            "click_element": {
                "prompt_instructions": "Click on the dropdown option '{soc_code_search_term[0]}'."
            }
        },
        "before_sleep_time": 2,
        "end_sleep_time": 1
    }
]
```

### How to select elements

you should use the select_option action.

```json
{
    "type": "action_node",
    "interaction_action": {
        "select_option": {
            "command": "get_by_label(\"Country\")",
            "select_values": ["United States"],
            "prompt_instructions": "Select United States from the country dropdown"
        }
    }
}
```

### How is select elements different from clicking on the drop down?

It is dependent on the website structure. if the element is select option then we use the select_option action. if it is a normal textbox which shows some options after we fill something then we use the input_text action and then click on the right option

### Automation is not working reliably as website does not load or downloads are not happening

If you believe automation is correct and not working, try changing the browser channel to Chrome.
